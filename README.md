ðŸŽ® About the Game
You are bornâ€¦ as a blob.
No memories. No clue why youâ€™re here. Just a squishy, clueless lifeform trying to make sense of existence â€” one click at a time.
In this lighthearted clicker game, youâ€™ll gather energy, unlock upgrades, and discover hilarious rebirths as your blob evolves.
